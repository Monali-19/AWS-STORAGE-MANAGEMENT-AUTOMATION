# AWS-STORAGE-MANAGEMENT-AUTOMATION
This project automates Amazon EBS snapshot creation and retention using AWS CLI, cron jobs, and Python. It also synchronizes files from EBS to Amazon S3 with versioning enabled for secure backup and easy recovery. IAM roles are used to ensure secure, credential-free access between EC2, EBS, and S3.
